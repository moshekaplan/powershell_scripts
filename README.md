## all_md5.ps1
Calculates MD5 hashes for files or folders.

Run with the following command:

`powershell ./all_md5.ps1 myfolder`
OR
`powershell ./all_md5.ps1 myfile`

The `./` in front is important!

If the file or folder contains a space, wrap it in single quotes (‘). For example:
`powershell ./all_md5.ps1 ‘myfile with spaces’`
